Honolulu,21.3069,-157.8583,Bilal,2025-05-08,"BilalBilal Sayeed Oliver is a truly independent artist. A singer, songwriter, and producer who has always been ahead of his time - blending jazz, afro-futurism, classic soul, alternative rs known for his wide vocal range, work across multiple genres, and magnetic live performances. Philip Bailey said Bilal is the rare singer who uses his voice like an instrument.Interscope Records signed Bilal to a major label recording deal fresh out of college, after studying jazz composition and opera at The New School in NYC. His debut album, First Born Second, showcased a range from the emotionally charged fan-favorite, Soul Sista, which peaked at No. 18 on the Top RFast Lane and Second Child.Playing jazz venues and recording more progressive soul music in the following years, Bilal has commercially released four albums to critical success. His unreleased but widely leaked second album Love for Sale found wide acclaim among critics and listeners. It features collabs with Dr. Dre and J Dilla and was built around Bilals own musicianship, included live instrumentation and had a vibe completely new and different from its predecessor. Interscope shelved the album indefinitely. It still received over half a million downloads and Bilal began touring even though there was no proper release of the album.Tickets $25-$35__________________________________________CLUB POLICIESSeating is First Come, First Served$20 Food or Beverage Minimum Per Person Full Bar & Full Dinner Menu AvailableNo refunds or exchange.

A singer, songwriter, and producer who has always been ahead of his time - blending jazz, afro-futurism, classic soul, alternative rs known for his wide vocal range, work across multiple genres, and magnetic live performances. Philip Bailey said Bilal is the rare singer who uses his voice like an instrument.Interscope Records signed Bilal to a major label recording deal fresh out of college, after studying jazz composition and opera at The New School in NYC. His debut album, First Born Second, showcased a range from the emotionally charged fan-favorite, Soul Sista, which peaked at No. 18 on the Top RFast Lane and Second Child.Playing jazz venues and recording more progressive soul music in the following years, Bilal has commercially released four albums to critical success. His unreleased but widely leaked second album Love for Sale found wide acclaim among critics and listeners. It features collabs with Dr. Dre and J Dilla and was built around Bilals own musicianship, included live instrumentation and had a vibe completely new and different from its predecessor. Interscope shelved the album indefinitely. It still received over half a million downloads and Bilal began touring even though there was no proper release of the album.Tickets $25-$35__________________________________________CLUB POLICIESSeating is First Come, First Served$20 Food or Beverage Minimum Per Person Full Bar & Full Dinner Menu AvailableNo refunds or exchange.

Relive the intimate storytelling, intricate chord changes and breathtaking melodies of these gifted artists - their work building on and transcending the more traditional folk-influenced acoustic music of the previous decade. Paul Simon, never one to rest on his laurels, started exploring even more harmonically-rich sounds than he had during his peerless Simon Still Crazy After All These Years and 50 Ways To Leave Your Lover. Jim Croce made an enormous impact in his criminally short time on earth with deceptively complex chord progressions, strummed and fingerpicked underneath accessible, stirring melodies in songs like Operator and Time In A Bottle that permeated the radio dial. And James Taylor emerged as the definitive singer-songwriter with his singular guitar style and uncanny ability to touch peoples hearts with that distinctive voice on classics like Fire And Rain and Carolina In My Mind. American Tune: Simon, Croce & Taylor showcases the songs you know and love from these master craftsmen during this brilliant span, framed in engaging stories about the artists themselves.

On his albums, Jonathan recorded several of Porters songs including; Love for Sale, Youd Be So Nice To Come Home To and So In Love. On May 2nd, Jonathan will be joined by a first class band, together they will bring Porters songs to life with clever arrangements and musical brilliance.Jonathan Karrants album, On and On hit #4 on the Billboard Jazz charts and his album Live hit #2 on the iTunes Jazz Charts. He has recorded with such artists as Diane Schuur, Jane Monhiet and Houston Person. Karrant has received honors throughout the states including; the New York City Cabaret Jazz Honors, Best Singer for the Bravo California Awards and he was named one of the top 10 rising jazz vocalists by Downbeat.

Buddy Holly, l'un des premiers membres du Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, a écrit et interprété d'innombrables chansons à succès au milieu des années 1950, telles que «That'll Be The Day», «Peggy Sue», «Maybe Baby», «Oh Boy» et bien d'autres encore. Bien que sa carrière n'ait duré que neuf ans, la musique de Buddy Holly a exercé une influence majeure sur les artistes populaires qui ont suivi, notamment Bob Dylan, les Beatles, les Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton et Elton John. Acteur et musicien accompli, Zachary a joué le rôle principal de Buddy Holly dans plus de 12 productions théâtrales différentes de la «Buddy Holly Story» à travers l'Amérique du Nord. Avec son style unique, son humour et un répertoire imposant sur Buddy, Zachary fait le pari de surprendre et divertir le public tout au long du spectacle, soutenu par le Rockin' Royals Band.",Music
